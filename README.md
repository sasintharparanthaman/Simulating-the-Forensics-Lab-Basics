Aim :
To install VirtualBox and set up a virtual machine(Kali Linux), install Autopsy and Sleuth Kit, and use them for forensic investigation by analyzing disk storage and file system.

Implementation Steps :
Step 1: Install VirtualBox
ðŸ”— Download VirtualBox: click here

Installation Steps:
Download the Windows hosts .exe file from the official VirtualBox website.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

In Disk Management, find your new disk (marked as "Not Initialized") -> Right-click the new disk â†’ Initialize Disk â†’ Select MBR.
Right-click Unallocated Space â†’ New Simple Volume â†’ Format the disk -> Click next â†’ Finish.
Output:
Virtual Box:


Virtual Machine (Kali Linux)




Autopsy


Sleuth Kit




Creation of Virtual Hard Disk


Result :
The installation of VirtualBox, Autopsy, and Sleuth Kit, along with the setup of Kali Linux - Virtual Machine and the creation of a new virtual disk, has been successfully completed.
